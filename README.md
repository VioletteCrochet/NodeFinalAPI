Three collections exist: "Character", "Alignement", "Classe".
Four different requests exist: "POST", "GET", "PUT" and "DELETE".

## POST
*This request is used to submit a document to the Database.*

Put in the URL location:
`localhost:*port*/*collectionName*`

To act on Character: 
`{ "name" : "",
"classe" : "",
"level" : ,
"alignement", }`
To act on Alignement: 
`{ "name" : "",
"cite" : "",
"level" }`
To act on Classe:
`{ "className" : "",
"spells" : "",
"role" : "" }`

## GET
*This request is used to show the elements of Database about the collection that you want.*

Put in the URL location:
`localhost:*port*/*collectionName*/*[optional]documentId*`



## DELETE
*This request is used to delete a character in the Database.*

Put in the URL location:
`localhost:*port*/*collectionName*/*characterId*`

## PUT
*This request is used to change an element of a collection.*

Put in the URL location:
`localhost:*port*/*collectionName*/*characterId*`

To update a Character:  
`{ "name" : "", "classe" : "", "level" : , "alignement", }`  
To update an Alignement:  
`{ "name" : "", "cite" : "", "level" }`  
To update a Classe:  
`{ "classeName" : "", "spells" : "", "role" : "" }`

There you have all the details and tips to nicely use the API.
in case you want to check out our data manually, open the "json" folder, a copy of each collection is available.
